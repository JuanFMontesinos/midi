title: Midi's Care
---

Midi is a lovely dog that eats twice a day (300 g of dog food):  
1. After the morning walk.
2. After the night walk.  
She expects you to give her permission to eat after serving food. You can do this by a gesture with your hand untils she starts eating or by saying the command "мошна", phonetically spelled as [moʂˈna].  


Midi will happily receive any extra bites, but there are some things she cannot eat:  
- Chocolate  
- Salty food (dogs' daily dose of salt is much less than humans). Excessive salt can be deadly.  
- Grapes & Raisins  
- Onions, Garlic, Leeks, Chives  
- Candies, gummies etcetera...  
- Macadamia nuts  
- Cooked bones, specially chicken bones. She can eat blunt bones.  
- Fish spines or any brittle and sharpened bone.  

She's a playful dog. Her favorite toy are balls. She likes to fetch the ball, or play pull-push. You have be a serious contestant and eventually let her win. Afterwards she likes to chew the ball enjoying the victory and be gently chased in an atempt from her carer to recover the ball.  


Midi cannot sleep in the bed, and is not expected to be on the couch (although you can break this rule).  



Midi is a trained dog and she understands many commands:  
- Patita (you offer your hand and she will give your her paw).  
- Down  
- Sit  
- Stay (to remain in a place without moving)  
- Conmigo (walk next to you, it doesn't last for too long :) )  
- Midi (her name, to gain her attention)  
And quite some others. Please, do not abuse of her name. When saying her name, you are calling her and looking for her attention. Repeating the word quite often makes it uneffective. Use it when needed.    
Midi is trained to come back to you whenever she is free. She may run but she will ultimately come back.  

# Behaviour  
- Midi is not an agressive dog. It is not gonna react against other agressive dogs. It doesn't bite (although it may herd you if you run or she is extremely excited). She is completely inofensive.  
- She gets extremely excited by skiers.  
- She is afraid of people and crowded areas.  
- She is afraid of strong sounds (weapons, fireworks, some motorbikes without silencer). She may run away under a nearby firework or shoot.    
- WHen she is scared she better be on leash. She may be irresponsive to commands.  
- She is not a hunting dog and will not bite or hunt other animals, although she may be curious and smell them.
