# Midi’s Care

Midi is a lovely dog that eats twice a day (300 g of dog food):

1. **After the morning walk**  
2. **After the night walk**

She expects you to give her permission to eat after serving food. You can do this by a hand gesture until she starts eating or by saying the command **мошна** (phonetically [moʂˈna]).

## Feeding Guidelines  
Midi will happily receive any extra bites, but there are some things she **cannot** eat:

- **Chocolate**  
- **Salty food** (dogs’ daily dose of salt is much less than humans’; excessive salt can be deadly)  
- **Grapes & raisins**  
- **Onions, garlic, leeks, chives**  
- **Candies, gummies, etc.**  
- **Macadamia nuts**  
- **Cooked bones** (especially chicken bones—she can eat blunt bones only)  
- **Fish spines** or any brittle, sharp bone  

She would be happy if you...  
- Give her **sausages** or any meat  
- A cube of ice if it is warm  
- Balls

## Playtime

Midi is playful and her favorite toys are balls. She loves to:

- **Fetch** the ball  
- **Play tug-of-war** (be a serious contestant and eventually let her win)  

After winning, she likes to chew the ball, enjoy her victory, and then be gently chased to recover it.

## Sleeping Arrangements

- Midi **cannot** sleep in the bed  
- She is **not** expected to be on the couch (though you can choose to break this rule)  

---

## Commands

Midi is well-trained and understands many commands:

- **Patita** – Offer your hand and she will give you her paw.  
- **Down**  
- **Sit**  
- **Stay** – Remain in place without moving.  
- **Conmigo** – Walk next to you (short distances).  
- **Midi** – Her name, used to gain attention. _Don’t overuse_ — repeating her name too often makes it ineffective.

She is trained to return to you if off-leash. She may run, but she will ultimately come back.

## Behaviour

- **Non-aggressive**: Won’t bite or react aggressively, though she may herd you if you run or she’s very excited.  
- **Excited by skiers**  
- **Afraid of people** and crowded areas  
- **Startled by loud noises** (fireworks, weapons, loud motorbikes) — may bolt if scared; keep her on leash in these situations.  
- **Not a hunting dog**: Won’t hunt or bite other animals, though she may sniff them out of curiosity.
