---

Midi is 4x4 dog that can go anywher. Let it be beaches, mountains, snow, white water rapids. She will take care of the hiking groups as a good herding dog.  

# Summer  
Summer can be a very demanding time for her as she is a black dog. She will happily go with you to:  
- Hikes early in the morning when it's cold.  
- Hikes with lots of shades (forests).  
- Hikes with lots of water sources to get refreshed (lakes, sea, mountain hikes with rivers).  
- If very warm and exposed to sun, she may need up to 1 liter of water per hour of hike.  

# Winter  
- She can walk in deep snow.  
- She will be a happy dog.  
- Be careful with skiers, she will be reaaaaally excited.  

# Group behaviour  
As a herding dog, she will take care of everyone. Let her run. She will come back.
