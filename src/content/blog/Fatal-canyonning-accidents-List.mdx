title: Fatal canyonning accidents List
---

The reason behind this dark list is two-fold. Firstly, I want to honor and remember those who shared our passion and to preserve their names for as long as I live. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, I want to show that this is an extreme sport that demands preparation and respect for the streams.

If you wish to include some event, please send me an email to [canyoning@juanmontesinos.com ](mailto:canyoning@juanmontesinos.com)copy paste this template and just replace:
